005. Next Permutation

Given an array of integers arr[] representing a permutation, implement the next
permutation that rearranges the numbers into the lexicographically next greater
permutation. If no such permutation exists, rearrange the numbers
into the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

Note - A permutation of an array of integers refers to a specific arrangement
of its elements in a sequence or linear order.

Examples:

Input: arr = [2, 4, 1, 7, 5, 0]
Output: [2, 4, 5, 0, 1, 7]
Explanation: The next permutation of the given array is {2, 4, 5, 0, 1, 7}.

Input: arr = [3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: As arr[] is the last permutation,
the next permutation is the lowest one.

Input: arr = [3, 4, 2, 5, 1]
Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
Explanation: The next permutation of the given array is [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
