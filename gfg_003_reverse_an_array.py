003. Reverse an Array

You are given an array of integers arr[].
Your task is to reverse the given array.

Note: Modify the array in place.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5.
After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position,
the second element goes to the second last position and so on.
Hence, the answer is 5 6 2 3 4 1.

Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]
Output: [2, 5, 4]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 4 5 2.
The reversed array will be 2 5 4.

Input: arr = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array has only single element,
hence the reversed array is same as the original.

Constraints:
1<=arr.size()<=10^5
0<=arr[i]<=10^5
