006. Majority Element II

You are given an array of integer arr[] where each number represents a vote
to a candidate. Return the candidates that have votes greater than one-third
of the total votes, If there's not a majority vote, return an empty array.

Note: The answer should be returned in an increasing format.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
Output: [5, 6]
Explanation: 5 and 6 occur more n/3 times.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: []
Explanation: o candidate occur more than n/3 times.

Constraint:
1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6
-109 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
